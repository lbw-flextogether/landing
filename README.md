# landing
project repo for the landing page

analyize the use case of our project.
for this project, we *need* to use semantic HTML.
we are primarily going to serve clientel who more likely than not will have sight issues.
some of these users may rely heavily on screen readers.

as such, we must use semantic HTML tags such as sections and buttons rather than divs..and well...divs.
